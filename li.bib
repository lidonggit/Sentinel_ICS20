    abstract = {This paper describes the Aggregate Remote Memory Copy Interface (ARMCI), a portable high performance remote memory access communication interface, developed oriinally   under the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Computational Testing and Simulation Toolkit project and currently used and advanced as a part of the run-time  layer of the DOE project, Programming Models for Scalble Parallel Computing. The paper discusses the model, addresses challenges of portable implementations, and demonstrates that ARMCI delivers high performance on a variety of platforms. Special emphasis is placed on the latency hiding mechanisms and ability to optimize  noncotiguous data transfers.

    abstract = {This paper describes capabilities, evolution, performance, and applications of the Global Arrays (GA) toolkit. GA was created to provide application programmers with   an inteface that allows them to distribute data while maintaining the type of global index space and programming syntax similar to that available when programming on a single processor. The goal of GA is to free the programmer from the low level management of communication and allow them to deal with their problems at the level at which they were originally formulated. At the same time, compatibility of GA with MPI enables the programmer to take advatage of the existing MPI software/libraries when available and appropriate. The variety of applications that have been implemented using Global Arrays attests to the attractiveness of using higher level abstractions to write parallel code.
